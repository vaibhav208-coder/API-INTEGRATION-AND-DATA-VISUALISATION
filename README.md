Description: Project Title: Weather Data Visualization Dashboard Using OpenWeatherMap API

Project Description:

This project focuses on integrating a public API—specifically, the OpenWeatherMap API—with Python to retrieve real-time weather data for various locations around the world. The data is then processed, analyzed, and visualized using popular Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. The end goal is to create a functional, visually intuitive dashboard that provides insightful visualizations about weather patterns across different regions.

Objective:

The main objective of the project is to demonstrate the complete pipeline of fetching external data via an API, handling and transforming that data using Python, and ultimately visualizing it to extract meaningful insights. It aims to provide a hands-on example of how APIs can be integrated into Python workflows and how data visualization techniques can make raw data more accessible and informative.

API Integration:

The OpenWeatherMap API is used to gather current weather data, including temperature, humidity, pressure, and weather conditions. The script makes HTTP requests to the API using Python's requests library, fetching JSON responses that are parsed and structured for further analysis. Users can input one or more city names or geographic coordinates, and the script will dynamically retrieve and update the weather data accordingly.

To make the data retrieval process more modular and reusable, the script is designed with functions that encapsulate specific tasks such as making API calls, parsing JSON data, and handling errors like invalid API keys or nonexistent locations.

Data Processing:

Once the data is retrieved, it is cleaned and organized into a Pandas DataFrame. Data preprocessing steps may include handling missing values, converting temperature units (e.g., from Kelvin to Celsius), and aggregating or filtering data based on user input or use-case requirements. The processed data is then ready for visualization.

Data Visualization:

Using Matplotlib and Seaborn, the script generates several visualizations to display weather data in an understandable format. Example visualizations include:

A bar chart comparing temperatures across different cities

A line graph showing temperature changes over time (if historical data is retrieved)

A heatmap showing correlations between weather attributes such as humidity, pressure, and temperature

A pie chart illustrating weather condition distributions (e.g., clear, cloudy, rain)

Each visualization is labeled and styled for clarity, and the dashboard layout ensures that the graphics are organized and easy to interpret.

Deliverables:

A complete Python script that performs data fetching, processing, and visualization

A visualization dashboard (in the form of static or interactive plots)

Documentation within the script for clarity and future modification

Optional enhancements such as interactive widgets using matplotlib.widgets or a web-based dashboard using frameworks like StreamlitName: Vansh Rathore Intern ID :CT04DL1392 DOMAIN:Python Programming DURATION:4 WEEKS MENTOR Neela Santhosh Kumar
